This repository contains the file for Group 14's CSE 151B Argoverse Challenge, Spring 2021.

A summary of the files:
- argoverse_final.ipynb contains the final models used for the challenge.
- exploratory_analysis contains notebooks that analyze the positions, velocities, lanes, and scenes in the Argoverse dataset.
- feature_extraction.ipynb contains the code used to extract features from the provided data for exploratory analysis.
- The "previous" folder contains approaches tried throughout the Spring 2021 quarter.

Note: The original data files and the extracted data files are not included because they are very large (i.e. over 1GB each).
